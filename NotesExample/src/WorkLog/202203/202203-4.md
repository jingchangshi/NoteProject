Investigate the 3 WENO limiters and the parameters of PWENO limiter in the DMR and SVI cases.

## DMR

Conclusions are as follows,

- MWENO and PWENO are good and comparable to each other, SWENO shows big oscillations
- PWENO has adjustable parameters and they indeed show differences while MWENO does not have adjustable parameters
- The higher value of `KTrunc` shows more dissipations while `Keps` does not show much differences
- MWENO shows less oscillations after the shock while achieves the same resolution in the vortex region as PWENO

Summary of cases are as follows,

On the grid `480x120`(grid03), compare the SWENO, PWENO, MWENO limiter.
Use

- the KXRCF shock sensor with $C_k=0.01$
- the correction function is `gDG`
- SP is Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto
- P2
- SSP-RK3

On the grid02(`960x240`), compare SWENO, MWENO and PWENO(`KTrunc=2,Keps=1E-2`) using `CFL=0.15(dt=[0.5E-5,1E-5])`.
